# Dev Portfolio

My portfolio project! Showcasing what I can do as well as projects I've made. I plan on updating this regularly as I create new projects and gain more work experience. Any reccomendations/issue reports are welcome!


## About Me
I'm a self-taught, full-stack web and software developer from Vancouver, Canada. I take pride in the finer details and overall quality of my work. I mostly use Javascript, however, am knowledgeable in a plethora of programming languages. I'm always trying to learn something new skills and expand upon my current ones.
